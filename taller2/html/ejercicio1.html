        project) and you would be required to use that diagram to create an XML instance
        document (root element, mid-level elements, attr√≠butes, and actual data content). The
        resulting XML. instance document must be well-formed and it must conform to the table
        of potential tags that is provided. <strong>DO NOT FORGET that the XML tags CANNOT
        CONTAIN SPACES within the actual tag <XML Command>.</strong></p>

    document. <strong> DO NOT FORGET that the XML tags CANNOT CONTAIN SPACES
    within the actual tag < XMLCommand>.</strong></p>
